The structure of our code is the following:

sr_handlepacket (called everytime the router receives a packet on an interface)
The router receives a packet. It then checks the ethernet header and determines what type of packet it is.
If the header has a header type of IP, then process it as a IP packet. Else, process it as an ARP packet. If the header type is not of either IP or ARP, drop the packet.

process_ip_packet (called everytime we recieve an IP packet)
The router checks the packet is valid (meets minimum length requirements, correct checksum). If not valid, drop the packet. Else, it then checks if the destination IP matches the router's.
If the destination IP matches the router, it will then check ip protocol is icmp. If the protocol is ICMP, it will check if the packet is valid and it will forward a ping response back to the origin. Else, it will send a Type 3 Code 3 icmp response back to the origin, indicating that the port is unreachable.
If the destination does not match the router, it will find the destination in the routing table with the longest prefix match. If this match does not exist, it means that the destination does not exist beyond the router and the router will send a Type 3 Code 0 response.
If the destination does not match the router, and a prefix match exists, it will forward the packet.

send_icmp_pkt (called everytime we need to send an ICMP response)
This method takes in parameters ICPM_TYPE and ICMP_CODE. It will create a new packet in memory with the appropriate headers modified from the original packet the ICMP packet is responding to.

forward_ip_packet (called everytime we forward an IP packet)
This method takes in the original packet. We look up the longest prefix match of the destination ip in the routing table. We the check the arp_cache to see if the destination ip already exists.
If the ip exists in the arp_cache, we decrement the TTL and update the checksum and send the packet through the appropriate interface designated by the arp_cache.
If the ip does not exist in the arp_cache, we queue an arp_cache request for the destination IP.

process_arp_packet (called everytime we receive an ARP packet)
The router checks if the arp packet is valid. If not valid, it drops the packet.
Else, it checks if the arp packet is a request or a reply.
If the packet is a request, it forwards
